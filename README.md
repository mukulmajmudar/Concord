Rsync-based sync tool, useful for managing local copies of a centrally stored authoritative source of files. AKA the poor man's Dropbox.

1. Uses sensible rsync defaults.
2. Shows a preview of the files that would be transferred and prompts for confirmation.
3. Optional backup of preexisting files that would be overwritten by any transfers.
4. Config file to store remote location, group of directories to be synced.
